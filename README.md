# Donation
A project to link donors and patients.

Having NodeJS insalled:

To install the app run 
	npm install

To start the app run
	npm start

To run tests run
	npm test
	
Missing requirements:
There are no features missing. The only requirement not fulfilled is having the app running live on the we,
because the free hostings that provide the services required to run the app are not so many. I have already used
my heroku and openshift accounts for other projects.
